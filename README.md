A fun and simple web application for loading a flickr image and display its position on a google map

There is not much to this, you're pulling a random flickr image that has location data and then plugging it in to a map.  The image and a map with a marker is then displayed on the page.

Requirements: PHP,  Flicker api key, Google Maps API.
